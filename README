Google Chrome Extension Page: http://bit.ly/kitpub-chrome

Typekit (http://typekit.com) is awesome, and they frequently update their font kits with new hinting, baselines, etc. In order for your kits to benefit from these updates, you have to republish them. If you have a lot of kits, that's a bit of a pain.

This extension puts a button in your Typekit header called "Republish All Kits" that will, you guessed it, republish all of your kits for you.

It works by gathering all of your kit ids and POSTing to the corresponding "publish" URL for each. It will also bypass the "your kit is really big" size warning.

Note: I've only tested this with my personal account, so your mileage may vary.
